# Hand-Sign-Detection-using-CNN
Hand Signs corresponding to digits 0 to 5 are detected using CNN . The programs are being written in Tensorflow


The basic objective of this project is to train our computers to understand sign languages. The images contain 5 different types of signs from 0 to 5 using hand gestures. The images below represent better understanding of the sign languages that are to be detected by the computer by training using CNN
